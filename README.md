# arai tasuku – Henry and Viora lost themselves / ヘンリーとヴィオラ

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
You are father
You are brother and sister
You are master,for me
I could not,i couldn't hold on
Why do you not disturb reason?
Go over the forbidden line with me
And sleep in the bed of the cocoon
We betray God and know the love
Hug me tight between heaven and hell
Please
Give me your love
Give me all of your love
I can not hold on anymore
```
